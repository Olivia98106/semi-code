The article titled "The Continued Domination of Western Journalists in Global African News Telling: The Imperatives and Implications" by Chikaire Wilfred Williams Ezeru employs a quantitative content analysis research method to investigate the representation of African news in four British national newspapers from 1992 to 2017, specifically focusing on the role of local African journalists versus their Western counterparts.

**Research Method**: The study utilizes a quantitative content analysis method, explicitly aiming to assess the frequency of articles authored by different types of journalists (African locals, Western, Afro-Western, joint contributions, and news agencies) published across three prominent UK newspapers: Daily Mail, The Guardian, Financial Times, and The Times. The coverage period spans **from 01 January 1992 to 31 December 2017**. Data was gathered using Lexis Nexis databases, resulting in a pool of approximately **31,000 news articles** generated with search terms like "Africa or African". A systematic random sampling method was applied by selecting every 5th article starting from the 5th, culminating in a final sample size of **6,110 articles**.

**Time Relevant Details**: Data collection took place over a lengthy span of **26 years**, segmenting articles into annually based datasets. Control measures were implemented at key intervals during coding phases, including two independent intercoder reliability tests conducted on **20% of the total sample**, yielding a high accuracy score (0.91) which reinforced the study's reliability.

**Sampling Method and Entity Type**: The study employed systematic random sampling to ensure the representation of various journalist types across the broad timeframe. The entities involved in the analysis consist of various journalist types including individuals (African local journalists, Western journalists, Afro-Western journalists) and organizational representatives (news agencies). Here, the entities serve as the unit of analysis, reflecting different authorship backgrounds in news article publication.

**Statistical Model**: The article details an analytical framework that emphasizes frequency distribution across categorized journalist groups based on authorship, which aids in discerning overall trends in the representation of African news.

**Unit of Analysis**: The unit of analysis for this research comprises individual news articles, specifically focusing on the author’s identity regarding their country of origin and journalistic background.

**Number of Entities or Sample Size**: The study’s empirical framework is outlined in terms of a total of **6,110 articles** analyzed throughout the designated timeframe. The distribution of journalist contributions indicates substantial dominance by Western journalists, with findings noted in Table 1, where **74.2% of the articles** were authored by Western journalists, significantly overshadowing those by African local counterparts who contributed only **3.2%** to the total. 

Overall, this research reveals a clear predominance of Western journalists in the portrayal of African narratives, suggesting ongoing challenges in achieving an equitable representation of diverse voices in global media discourse.
