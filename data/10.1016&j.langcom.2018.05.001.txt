**Summary of Research Article: Investing in Indigenous Multilingualism in the Arctic by Sari Pietikäinen**

- **Research Method:** The study utilizes a longitudinal critical discourse ethnography approach to investigate the complex dynamics of language and identity categories within the indigenous Sámi communities in the Finnish Arctic. The data collection process involved engaging directly with the community, gathering qualitative data over the period of the Cold Rush research project, which spanned from 2016 to 2020.

- **Time Relevant Details:** Data was collected through various methods at multiple time intervals throughout the project. The longitudinal nature allowed for the examination of evolving language practices and identity constructions at different stages. This temporal dimension is essential in understanding the processes of multilingualism and identity in the context of ongoing global and local changes.

- **Sampling Method and Entity Type:** Purposeful sampling was employed to select participants and contexts that were pivotal to the study. The entities involved primarily comprise individuals from the indigenous Sámi community, including speakers of the Sámi languages and those engaging in language revitalization efforts, hence the unit of analysis is at the individual level.

- **Statistical Model:** The analysis applies a discourse analytical framework that views language practices and identity categories as socially constructed and interlinked through various discourses. It incorporates insights from critical sociolinguistics to unpack the relationships between language, power, and identity within the Sámi context.

- **Unit of Analysis:** The unit of analysis in this research is predominantly individuals and their language practices. It focuses on how these individual practices relate to broader discursive formations and societal discourses affecting the Sámi community.

- **Number of Entities or Sample Size:** While the article does not specify exact numbers in the analysis model section, observations and data compiled during interviews, community interactions, and ethnographic engagements suggest a sample that includes dozens of participants from various Sámi language speakers and community members engaged in discussions about language and identity issues. Detailed tables and figures may provide further insights into the sample size during specific stages of data collection or analysis. 

This comprehensive exploration bridges the theoretical frameworks of multilingualism with practical, community-based realities, emphasizing the socio-political implications tied to language and identity in the Arctic region.
