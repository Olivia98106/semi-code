**Research Method:** The study employed a cross-lagged panel design to investigate changes in ethnic self-identification and heritage language preference over time. It utilized data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study, collected in three waves: the first in 1992 when participants were in early to mid-adolescence, the second in 1995-1996 while graduating from high school, and a third wave in 2001-2003 as young adults. This longitudinal approach allowed researchers to assess how changes unfolded over distinct time intervals, emphasizing developmental trends within the adolescent period.

**Time Relevant Details:** Data collection spanned three intervals: Wave 1 in 1992, Wave 2 roughly three years later in 1995-1996, and Wave 3 a decade later from 2001-2003. Each interval captured different life stages of the participants, marking the transitions from early to late adolescence and then to young adulthood.

**Sampling Method and Entity Type:** The study utilized a non-probability sampling method, focusing on second-generation adolescents of various ethnic backgrounds in metropolitan areas of Southern Florida and Southern California. The unit of analysis here consisted of individuals, specifically the second-generation adolescents with Latin American or Asian heritage, ensuring a diverse representation of ethnic minority groups.

**Statistical Model:** The analysis applied multilevel modeling to account for the nested structure of the longitudinal data and to examine the relationships among repeated measures of ethnic self-identification and heritage language preference across time. Logistic regression analysis was specifically employed for the binary categorical measure of heritage language preference.

**Unit of Analysis:** The primary unit of analysis in the statistical model was the individual adolescent participant. This structure allowed for the examination of changes and relationships over time within the same individuals.

**Number of Entities or Sample Size:** The sample size included a total of 2,777 respondents analyzed in the study, with 2,139 participants identified as of Latin American descent and 638 from Asian descendants.
