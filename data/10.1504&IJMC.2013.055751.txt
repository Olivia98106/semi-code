**Summary of the Research Article**

- **Research Method**: The study employed a stated preference (SP) survey method to understand the impact of Graphical Route Information Panels (GRIPs) on taxi drivers' decisions to divert. The data was collected via questionnaires designed to simulate different driving scenarios along a specific urban freeway in Shanghai. This data collection occurred over May 2008 and included six choice scenarios presented to each participant.

- **Time Relevant Details**: The survey's data collection procedure focused on responses to six pre-defined hypothetical scenarios. Each driver participated in only one set of choices within a specified time frame in May 2008, capturing their diversion behavior under various traffic conditions.

- **Sampling Method and Entity Type**: The sampling method was random, targeting drivers at the PuDong International Airport parking lot, making it easier to gather responses from taxi driversâ€”a significant segment of the sample. The entities involved in the study are primarily individuals (drivers), with specific emphasis on taxi drivers, but also included private car drivers and employer-provided car drivers.

- **Statistical Model**: The analysis utilized an ordered logit model, which specifically included both cross-sectional and panel data frameworks to explore drivers' diversion probabilities based on provided GRIP information.

- **Unit of Analysis**: The unit of analysis in the statistical model is the individual driver, denoted by the index 'i' in the model formulations.

- **Number of Entities or Sample Size**: The study collected data from 108 drivers, of which 85 valid responses were used in the analysis, as indicated in the results sections of the paper.

Overall, the research highlights the behavioral responses of drivers to GRIP messages, contributing insights into the importance of user experience in intelligent transportation systems.
