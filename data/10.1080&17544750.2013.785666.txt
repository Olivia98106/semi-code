This research article by Yuntsai Chou analyzes the impact of unbundled local loops (ULL) on broadband uptake and the development of next-generation networks (NGNs) across 42 OECD and APEC economies from 1991 to 2009. Hereâ€™s a summary based on the requested aspects:

- **Research Method:** The study employs an econometric panel data analysis, utilizing seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) to gauge the intertwined effects of various broadband access regimes. The data collection procedure involved compiling indicators from multiple international databases including the ITU, OECD, and others, covering a duration of 18 years, with each year's data examined for effects on broadband penetration.

- **Time relevant details:** Data were collected annually from 1991 to 2009, allowing for the study of interactions and changes in broadband uptake and regulatory impact over time, with specific attention given to the annual adoption rates for DSL and cable internet penetration.

- **Sampling Method and Entity Type:** The sampling method involved selecting a panel dataset from 42 OECD and APEC economies, with the entities defined as countries. Each country represents the unit of analysis within the broader context of telecommunication market players.

- **Statistical Model:** The statistical model employed is a simultaneous equation model combining SUR with structural equation modeling (SEM), allowing for the capture of correlated errors and the complex interdependencies between broadband penetration rates for DSL and cable services.

- **Unit of Analysis:** The unit of analysis in the statistical model is the economy (country), allowing for comparisons of regulatory impacts across different nations.

- **Number of entities or Sample Size:** The total sample size consists of 798 observations drawn from data across the 42 countries over the specified time period, with analysis focusing on changes to broadband penetration rates influenced by the ULL regime.

This econometric analysis provides insights into how regulatory frameworks can significantly influence technological upgrades and market competition, particularly in the context of broadband access and the evolution toward next-generation infrastructures.
