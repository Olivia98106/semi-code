### Summary of the Research Article

**Research Method**: The study employs a longitudinal, retrospective, and descriptive research method aimed at analyzing doctoral theses on radio defended in Spain from 1976 to 2008. The data collection procedure involved extracting information from the TESEO database, focusing on variables such as the frequency of terms in titles, the evolution of thesis defenses over periods, universities involved, thesis directors, and genealogical relationships between advisors and candidates. The data collection took place over the years of the study period (1976-2008), with specific attention given to different intervals such as 1980, 1993-1997, and others for insightful trajectory analysis.

**Time Relevant Details**: Data were collected across the specified timeframe of 1976 to 2008, highlighting significant annual production trends in specific periods such as 1983-1992, 1993-1997, and the pivotal years in the late 1990s when a notable increase in theses production was observed. The researchers also analyzed the frequency of thesis defenses in five-year intervals, helping to reveal patterns of academic activity over time.

**Sampling Method and Entity Type**: The sampling method involved a systematic search and retrieval process through existing records, focusing on 118 doctoral theses. The entities involved as the unit of analysis were individual doctoral candidates and their respective universities. Each thesis served as a case study, with analyses conducted on the relationships among various academic actors (thesis advisors and committee members).

**Statistical Model**: The analysis utilized social network analysis techniques to evaluate interactions among academic actors, assessing centrality measures such as degree, closeness, and betweenness, which reveal insights into the academic relationships and networks formed through thesis defenses.

**Unit of Analysis**: The unit of analysis in the statistical model comprises individual thesis advisors and the doctoral candidates they directed, alongside the examination committees involved in thesis defenses.

**Number of Entities or Sample Size**: The total number of entities analyzed in this research is 118 theses. As indicated in the tables and results sections, 78 distinct advisors directed these theses, with a notable 307 different academics participating across examination boards during the study period from 1976 to 2008, indicating a broad and diverse network within the academic community focused on radio research in Spain.
