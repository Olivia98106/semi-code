**Summary of Research Article: A Longitudinal Study on Mobile Application Uses and Online News Engagement**

- **Research Method**: The study utilizes a longitudinal design based on a four-wave panel dataset collected from a sample of the South Korean population. The data was obtained through annual household visits and self-reported surveys conducted every year from June to July, specifically covering the years 2013 to 2016. The timescale selected allows researchers to monitor changes over multiple intervals as they explore the effects of motivational mobile application usage on online news engagement.

- **Time Relevant Details**: The data collection occurred annually over a span of four years, from the first wave in 2013 to the final wave in 2016, thereby allowing for the observation of changes in the dependent variable, online news engagement, at four distinct time points. Throughout the four-year span, data on the various mobile application usage types was collected to analyze their impact on online news engagement.

- **Sampling Method and Entity Type**: The sampling method used was a stratified sampling approach, ensuring representation across demographic variables such as gender, age, income, and education. The entities involved in this study were individuals from 5,000 households across 17 cities and provinces in South Korea, representing the unit of analysis involved in the research.

- **Statistical Model**: The analysis employed a latent growth model that integrates both unconditional and conditional modeling approaches. This model estimated individual changes in online news engagement over time while accounting for measurement errors and the impact of various predictors.

- **Unit of Analysis**: The unit of analysis in this study is individuals, as the research examines how each respondent's mobile application use and online news engagement behaviors change over the specified time period.

- **Number of Entities or Sample Size**: The total sample size included 20,464 individuals in 2013, with subsequent years having 10,171 (2014), 9,873 (2015), and 9,788 (2016) respondents. However, the final analysis focused on a subset of 1,057 individuals who reported their engagement across all four years, making them the consistent unit of analysis for longitudinal insights.

Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the relationship between mobile application usage motives—namely informational, recreational, and relational—and online news engagement, emphasizing the predominant role of relational usage over time.
