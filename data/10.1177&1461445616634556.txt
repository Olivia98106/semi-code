### Summary of the Research Article

#### Research Method:
The study employs a conversation and discourse analytical approach focusing on the dynamics of organizational planning processes through the examination of meetings within a Finnish city organization. The data collection procedure included videotaping approximately 15 hours of meetings held over 18 months, with the primary focus on the development of customer services. Data were collected following a series of structured project stages, notably during the second and third stages, involving shared future planning activities interlaced with discussions, presentations, and planning interactions.

#### Time Relevant Details:
The data collection spanned 18 months, with an emphasis on the initial six months when new customer service models were actively planned. Within this timeframe, the meetings allowed for data to be gathered at different stages of the project, emphasizing shared future planning interspersed with presentations and discussions, thus creating a timeline that captures the evolution of ideas over regular intervals.

#### Sampling Method and Entity Type:
The research utilized a purposive sampling method, focusing on participants involved in the customer service project, which included city employees from various departments, a project leader, outside consultants, and guest speakers. The entities involved in this study represent individuals (employees) within a specific organizational context, serving as the unit of analysis for the interactions analyzed.

#### Statistical Model:
The analysis involves a discourse analysis framework that examines the use of conditional constructions as a means to resist proposals within meeting interactions. The interactions are scrutinized to uncover regularities and patterns in how language functions in organizational dynamics, notably regarding the implicit rejection of proposals.

#### Unit of Analysis:
The unit of analysis in the statistical model is the conditional constructions used in the discourse during meetings. This involves examining how these linguistic structures facilitate the expression of disagreement without overt rejection of proposals.

#### Number of Entities or Sample Size:
The study analyzed a total of 29 instances where conditional constructions were employed, as extracted from the video transcriptions of the meetings. The detailed interactions reflect the participation of approximately 30 city employees, with specifics of their roles and contributions to the meeting dynamics outlined in the results section of the article.
