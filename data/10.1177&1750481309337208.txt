**Summary of Research Article**

- **Research Method:** The study utilized a longitudinal ethnography method focusing on decision-making episodes in a senior management team meeting of a multinational company. It embedded the Discourse-Historical Approach (DHA) to Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) within its framework, allowing the researchers to gain insights into the complex power dynamics at play during organizational discussions.

- **Time Relevant Details:** Data collection spanned over two years and involved multiple time intervals for gathering insights. Specifically, after in-depth interviews with team members and stakeholders, the researchers observed and recorded regular management meetings for six months, resulting in a comprehensive dataset: over 300 hours of transcriptions, including around 90 hours from interviews, 180 hours from meetings, and 40 hours from other related events. 

- **Sampling Method and Entity Type:** The researchers employed purposeful sampling, targeting a senior management team located within the Australian business unit of a multinational defense company. The focus was on analyzing individuals (members of the senior management team) as the primary entities involved in decision-making processes, making the unit of analysis the group dynamics and discursive practices within the senior management team.

- **Statistical Model:** The analysis relied on a qualitative approach utilizing the Discourse-Historical Approach (DHA), which does not adhere to conventional statistical models but instead emphasizes the interpretation of discursive strategies utilized in organizational contexts.

- **Unit of Analysis:** The unit of analysis consisted of the discursive interactions and strategies employed by the senior management team during decision-making processes. This included how they communicated and negotiated decisions concerning organizational challenges.

- **Number of Entities or Sample Size:** The study involved a senior management team comprised of approximately eight individuals, with insightful contributions analyzed over multiple episodes documenting discussions that unfolded across the two-year investigation, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the decision-making landscape.
