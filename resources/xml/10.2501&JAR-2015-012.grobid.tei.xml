<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Star power, genre, sequel, and word of mouth (WOM), are among the critical factors affecting a film 's box-office success. The current study added a new wrinkle to the WOM factor, analyzing whether advertising in the form of product placements in films affected consumer enjoyment of the movie, and, in turn, whether the related positive or negative WOM about the film affected box-office revenues. The authors investigated the relationship between product placements and the performance of 122 movies released between 2000 and 2007 and found that product placements had both helpful and harmful consequences. Product placements exhibited a positive relationship with movie revenues, but when used in excess (i'.e., more than 44 placements per movie) the relationship with revenues turned negative.</p></div>

A few successful examples in film include "Wings," a 1927 movie and the winner of the first Academy Award for Most Outstanding Production, which featured Hershey's chocolate bars. The first movie in the James Bond series, "Dr. No," plugged the Aston Martin automobile and Smirnoff vodka. The Hershey Company's Reese's Pieces appeared in "E.T."; Tom Cruise wore Ray-Ban sunglasses in "Risky Business" and "Top Gun"; and Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Etch-a-Sketch, and Barbie, among other toy brands, have been placed in the three "Toy Story" animated movies.</p><p>Whether visual or audible, product placementdefined as the inclusion of a product, brand, or M amagtgmtsoijS ® lainrS</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The relationship between product placement and the benefits a consumer receives from media programing is robust across movies with different budgets and qualities.</p><p>• These findings have important managerial implications for both media programmers and advertisers, who may need to reevaluate the widely assumed negative effects of product placements.</p><p>firm in entertainment programing for pro motional purposes <ref type="bibr">(d'Astous and Chartier, 2000)</ref>-is an important part of the productservice marketing mix. Global spending on product placement in film and television totaled an estimated $10.6 billion in 2014 <ref type="bibr">(PQ Media, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>There is a rich tradition of research about product placements describing consumers' attitudes toward the practice and the effects on viewers <ref type="bibr">(McCarty and Lowrey, 2012)</ref>. To the authors' knowledge, however, there is less work describing the relationship between product placement and the performance of the programing in which the brands or products appear.</p><p>On some occasions, the direct impact on the bottom line of the content producer is evident: Heineken, for example, reportedly paid $45 million to appear in the James Bond movie, "Skyfall" <ref type="bibr">(Graser, 2012)</ref>. But, in other instances, the broader relationship between product placement and mediaprograming performance is less clearly defined: Two prom inent brands that appeared in the movie, "Up in the Air"-American Airlines and Hilton Hotels-for example, did not pay the production com pany, Paramount; instead, they provided production locations for filming (such as in airports, airplanes, and hotels) and brand ing that helped defray what otherwise would have been incrementally massive production costs <ref type="bibr">(Hampp, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Although the means to the end of brand engagement might matter, whether the engagement is direct (Heineken) or indi rect (American Airlines and Hilton Hotels) is important to programmers and place ment firms in that it may affect pricing strategies and negotiation outcomes.</p><p>The authors do not claim product place ment as the principal driver of box office performance for movies. Clearly a number of other factors are critical to the success or failure of movie, including, but not lim ited to</p><p>• star performers <ref type="bibr">(De Vany and Walls, 1999)</ref>,</p><p>• directors and producers <ref type="bibr">(Hennig-Thurau, Walsh, and Wruck, 2001</ref>), • advertising <ref type="bibr">(Faber and O'Guinn, 1984)</ref>,</p><p>• number of screens <ref type="bibr">(Swami, Eliashberg, and Weinberg, 1999</ref>), • moviegoers' word of mouth <ref type="bibr">(Bruce, Foutz, and Kolsarici, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Craig, Greene, and Versaci, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moon, Bergey, and Iacobucci, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Neelamegham and Chintagunta, 1999</ref>), • Motion Picture Association of America ratings <ref type="bibr">(Prag and Casavant, 1994</ref>), • genre <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Litman, 1983)</ref>, and</p><p>• sequel <ref type="bibr">(Hennig-Thurau, Houston, and Walsh, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Prior studies have indicated that product placements improve consumer aware ness, brand image, and sales of the placed product (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Russell and Belch, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Van der Waldt, Du Toit, and Redelinghuys, 2007)</ref>, but their relationship with the rev enues of the surrounding media content is unknown. The authors of the current arti cle believe that their research addresses this important gap. Customers' utility (i.e., enjoyment)-the total satisfaction received from consuming a good or service-is a vital component in measuring the effect of advertising-and in the instance of this study, product place ments in media programing.</p><p>Arguments suggest the possibility of both positive and negative effects of product placements for consumers of entertainment programing. For example, on the positive side, product placements have been shown to increase realism of the programing for consumers (DeLorme and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reid, 1999)</ref>, whereas on the negative side, product placements have been shown to interrupt the viewing experience for con sumers (Cowley and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Barron, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Opinions among prominent filmmakers about the effects of product placements also vary. David Lynch <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Lynch, 2008)</ref> has observed, "Product placement in a film putrefies the environment. It is so absurd, but it is happening more and more. <ref type="bibr">" And, Ron Howard (Dretzka, 1998, p. 16</ref>) has said, "I don't feel using an actual product detracts from the movie. It creates oppor tunities, enhances the story and can actu ally draw people in."</p><p>Scholars, in fact, have found that effect ive product placements can enhance a viewer's experience by increasing real ism, such as the use of real beer brands in "Forrest Gump" (e.g., <ref type="bibr">DeLorme and Reid, 1999)</ref>, whereas incongruent product place ments can diminish a viewer's experience by being out of place (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Russell, 2002)</ref>, ceteris paribus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Word of Mouth and Films</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>With Product Placements</head><p>To examine the relationship between prod uct placements and media-programing performance, the authors mined data on 122 movies released between 2000 and 2007 in which there were 1,497 occasions of product placement (See Methodology-The Data, p. 327).</p><p>The data indicated an inverted U-shaped relationship. Holding all other movie characteristics constant, the link between product placement and movie perfor mance (revenue, as measured by gross weekly ticket sales) was positive initially, but excessive placements led to a nega tive turn. This finding does not mean that product placements alone drove the suc cess or failure of a movie; instead, product placements, on average, helped a movie be more successful unless used in excess, in which case they could hurt a movie's box office revenue, ceteris paribus.</p><p>As part of their analysis, the authors completed additional study on the rela tionship between product placements and consumer word of mouth (WOM), as measured by consumer ratings. Drawing from previous research that defined the relationship between WOM and perfor mance of film, the authors speculated that the significant relationship between product placements and movie box-office performance likely reflected online and offline WOM. That is, if product place ments increased consum ers' overall enjoyment of the film, overall WOM, as measured by consumer ratings would increase, ceteris paribus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I f t h e s i g n i f i c a n t r e l a t i o n s h i</head><p>Indeed, consumers often rely on WOM and recommendations from other view ers when deciding which movie to watch (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Chintagunta, Gopinath, and Venkataraman, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Liu, 2006)</ref>. And consumer WOM has been shown to affect the perfor mance of movies both directly (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bruce et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Craig et ah, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moon et al, 2009)</ref> and indirectly through greater buzz (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Duan, Gu, and Whinston, 2008)</ref>. If the significant relationship between prod uct placements and movie performance is because of WOM, the current authors expected to see a significant relationship between product placements and con sumer WOM. Using data on the same 122 movies, the results showed that when holding all other movie-performance char acteristics constant, a significant, positive relationship between product placements and consumer WOM existed.</p><p>The findings from this study may help inform negotiations between media pro grammers and advertisers. Advertisers may have more leverage because of the increased value product placements have to program mers. Alternatively, programmers may have more leverage because of the larger audi ences and more favorable brand attitudes from product placements. Additionally, as the example from the movie, "Up in the Air," shows, the two parties can benefit from collaborative integrations of products in the content, instead of relying solely on a monetary exchange <ref type="bibr">(Hampp, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>Product placement in program ing is nearly as old as the movie industry. In 1896, the Sunlight Soap brand appeared in the French film "Defile du 8e Bataillon" <ref type="bibr">(Newell, Salmon, and Chang, 2006)</ref>. Product-placement discussions in the popular press began in the late 1970s. Scholars introduced product placement as a hybrid message with elements of both advertising and publicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balasubramanian, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Most of the resulting literature on prod uct placement has focused on its effect on consumers, such as their • attitudes toward product placements and their related consumption expe riences (de Gregorio and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sung, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">DeLorme and Reid, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nelson, 2002)</ref>, • brand recognition and recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bressoud, Lehu, and Russell, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">d'Astous and Chartier, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dens, De Pelsmacker, Wouters, and Purnawirawan, 2012</ref>; Rus sell, 2002),</p><p>• brand attitudes (Cowley and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Barron, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Homer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Russell and Stern, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tiwsakul, Hackley, and Szmigin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Van Reijmersdal, 2009)</ref>, or • purchase intentions and choices <ref type="bibr">(Hang, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Law and Braun, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Morton and Friedman, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Another stream of product-placement literature addresses film -production companies and advertising firms. An application of social-exchange theory and qualitative expert interviews indi cated that advertising firms use product placements as a communication tool, whereas the production companies use them to offset production costs and for cross-promotional opportunities <ref type="bibr">(Chang, Newell, and Salmon, 2009)</ref>. These views seemingly have changed over time, though, such that each side recognizes trade-offs between the financial benefits and creative harms of product placements <ref type="bibr">(Karrh, McKee, and Pardun, 2003)</ref>. Event studies also have specified the product placement's worth to the advertising firm <ref type="bibr">(Karniouchina, Uslay, and Erenburg, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wiles and Danielova, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The authors of the current study found a notable gap in the literature: full consid eration of the relationship between prod uct placement and the performance of the placement medium (e.g., movie, television show, video game). In the context of film, a number of factors have been shown to determine box-office performance, includ ing star power, directors-producers, and WOM (See Introduction). Extant literature has predicted some potential implica tions of the effect of product placements but no conclusive or empirical evidence. For example, film production companies should be wary of the continued use of prominent product placements to avoid potentially lowering consumers' attitudes toward media programing and decreasing audience sizes <ref type="bibr">(Homer, 2009)</ref>. In addition to addressing this gap, the current study represented a response to scholars' calls to explore the placement saturation (Balasubram anian, <ref type="bibr">Karrh, and Patwardhan, 2006</ref>) that occurs when too many product placements appear in media programing and, thereby, invoke negative reactions by consumers. This negative reaction, the current authors presumed, may be related to lower overall performance of the programing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C o n cep tu al B ackground</head><p>Product placement is a form of advertis ing. Advertising has three broad roles: per suasive, informative, and complementary <ref type="bibr">(Bagwell, 2007)</ref>:</p><p>• In its "persuasive" role, advertising creates product differentiation and brand loyalty by altering customers' tastes, mainly through repeated expo sures to advertisements (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Boulding, Lee, and Staelin, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Comanor and Wilson, 1967)</ref>.</p><p>• In its "informative" role, advertising provides customers with information vital to their purchase decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Eckard, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nelson, 1970</ref><ref type="bibr">Nelson, , 1974))</ref>, whether directly (e.g., price) or indirectly (e.g., quality signaled by the level of firm spending on advertising).</p><p>• In its "complementary" role, advertising targets some innate and stable prefer ences of customers (be., social prestige), through which it increases customers' use or satisfaction. This effect helps rec oncile the persuasive influence of adver tising (Galbraith, 1967) with consumer utility maximization (i.e., maximizing benefits given resource constraints).</p><p>Some scholars have suggested examining complementary advertising from the per spective of whether it is "good" or "bad" for the consumer <ref type="bibr">(Becker and Murphy, 1993)</ref>. "Good"-positive, in this sensemeans the advertising enhances consumer benefits; "bad"-negative-lessens con sumer benefits.</p><p>The authors considered that product placements have positive relationships w ith program ing perform ance only because the advertising enhances the overall consumption experience, holding all other characteristics (star power, etc.) constant. When consumers like a prod uct better, they will spread more posi tive WOM, all else equal. In the context of films, WOM has been shown to be an im portant determ inant of movie per formance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bruce et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Craig et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Duan et a]., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moon et al., 2009)</ref>. In the authors' view, however, if the advertising diminishes the overall con sumption experience, consumers provide less positive WOM. The current authors do not claim that product placements are a principal driver of consumer WOM but instead are a factor among a host of fac tors that affect WOM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product P la c em e n ts as a Positive</head><p>To be considered positive, product placem ents m ust enhance the con sumption experience consumers obtain from media programing. If used appro priately, product placements increase the realism of the programing (DeLorme and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reid, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sung, De Gregorio, and Jung, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Van der Waldt et al., 2007)</ref>. Consumers may find a movie more realistic, for example, if product placements help them:</p><p>• place a story in the past (DeLorme and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reid, 1999)</ref>, such as with the placement of Miller Beer in the 1955 Hill Valley, California, setting in "Back to the Future"; • imagine a narrative in the future, such as with the placement of Nike lace-free high-tops in the 2015 Hill Valley setting of "Back to the Future II."1 But moviegoers may feel "irritated and insulted by generic product props" (DeLorme and <ref type="bibr">Reid, 1999, p. 78)</ref>. As LeeAnne Stables, Paramount's executive vice president of worldwide marketing partnerships, has said with respect to the aforementioned "Up in the Air": "I think depicting fake brands would take people more out of the movie. This is a movie depicting the lives of real people, who are involved with brands every day of their life" <ref type="bibr">(Hampp, 2009)</ref>. This effect likely explains why consumers have "generally favorable attitudes toward product place ments" <ref type="bibr">(Gupta and Gould, 1997, p. 37)</ref>, with some exceptions for ethically charged items such as alcohol, cigarettes, and guns <ref type="bibr">(Gupta and Gould, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nebenzahl and Secunda, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>By enhancing the realism of moviesthe authors considered, drawing from earlier research-product placements may help "transport" moviegoers in a film. Transportation is a "distinct mental pro cess and integrative melding of attention, imagery, and feelings" (Green and <ref type="bibr">Brock, 2000, p. 701)</ref>, and this engagement with a ' The current authors' use of movie examples is illustrative; testing whether each specific example actually enhanced or detracted from the audience's consumption experience was beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>Septem ber 2 0 1 5 JO URnfiL OF HDUERTISIflG RESEARCH 325 narrative world may increase enjoyment <ref type="bibr">(Green, Brock, and Kaufman, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Realism is an influential determinant of audience enjoyment <ref type="bibr">(Ang, 1985)</ref> and may increase positive attitudes toward a movie <ref type="bibr">(Koordeman, Anschutz, and Engels, 2014)</ref>. Because personal experiences have the strongest influences on WOM <ref type="bibr">(Allsop, Bassett, and Hoskins, 2007)</ref>, greater realism should encourage more positive WOM in accordance with the audience's positive attitudes. WOM, in turn, exerts a strong effect on the success of entertain ment goods in general <ref type="bibr">(Chevalier and Mayzlin, 2006)</ref> and movies in particular <ref type="bibr">(Chintagunta et al, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Craig et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Liu, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, if product placements relate positively to movie realism, whichthe authors presum ed-can increase enjoyment by transporting audiences, then product placements also should have a positive relationship with movie performance because of increased posi tive WOM.</p><p>Additional arguments further suggest product placements are positive when • movie-going frequency relates posi tively to attitudes toward product placement (de Gregorio and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sung, 2010)</ref>. According to exposure theory, as a person watches more movies, his or her exposure to product placements increases, and the person becomes more familiar with the practice; this familiar ity results in more positive attitudes (de Gregorio and Sung, 2010). Thus, the authors asserted, people who most likely will consume movies also are the people who mostly likely will enjoy product placements.</p><p>• consumers who communicate with peers about brands tend to have posi tive attitudes toward product place ments (de Gregorio <ref type="table"></ref>and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Sung, 2010)</ref>. In the context of movies, which often is a social activity, product placements provide more opportunity for these consumers to discuss brands among their peers, which may enhance the consumer's benefit from watching the movie (de Gregorio and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sung, 2010)</ref>. This reasoning also suggests a positive relationship between the consumer's familiarity with the placed products and the performance of the media pro graming, as indicated by extant litera ture on product placements (DeLorme and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reid, 1999)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>By e n h a n c in g t h e re a lis m o f m o v ie s -t h e a u th</head><p>Overall, the consequences of positive product placements that may enhance the movie-going experience include</p><p>• increased realism;</p><p>• a positive relationship between movie going frequency and attitudes toward product placements; • a positive relationship between brand familiarity and attitudes toward product placements.</p><p>Therefore, the authors proposed, a posi tive relationship should arise between product placement and programing per formance, as well as between the propor tion of placements that feature familiar brands and programing performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product P la c e m e n t as a N egative</head><p>When product placements interrupt the viewing experience and prompt consum ers to consider the commercial intent of the placement, they decrease the utility (i.e., enjoyment, interest) that consumers experience from consuming media pro graming and detract from their consump tion experience (Cowley and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Barron, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>If the audience believes the producer has been obligated to insert placements in the content to earn auxiliary sources of income, their consumption experience likely suffers <ref type="bibr">(Cowley, 2012)</ref>. Moreover, incongruent product placements that do not fit the plot adversely affect brand atti tudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Russell, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The use of 30-year-old Converse All-Stars by Will Smith's character in "I, Robot," and the extended consumption of Pepsi One in a single scene by actor Rene Russo's character in "The Thomas Crown Affair," were cited widely as inappropriate product placements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Carlson, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>These placements were not seamless, and their incongruence distracted viewers from the overall consumption experience <ref type="bibr">(McCarty, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Because such product placements may decrease the benefit consumers obtain from their media consum ption, they also might have negative effects on atti tudes toward the media programing. In this case, product placements may nega tively affect the movie-going experience, leading to less positive WOM about the movie, holding all other performancerelated factors (star power, etc.) constant.</p><p>The resulting relationship between prod uct placements and programing perfor mance likely is negative.</p><p>The authors do not claim that product placements need to be discussed to have an effect on WOM. Rather, product place ments can</p><p>• enhance the consum er experience through, for example, greater realism (DeLorme and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reid, 1999)</ref>, or • detract from the consumer experience through, for example, interrupted view ing (Cowley and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Barron, 2008)</ref>, leading to more positive or less positive WOM, all else equal. Detailing actual WOM on the movies used in the current analysis is beyond the scope of this article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P o s it iv e a n d N e g a t iv e P r o d u c t P l a c e m e n t</head><p>Excessive product placem ents make it difficult to combine advertisements seamlessly with media programing and increase the possibility of hindering the consumer's viewing experience. In partic ular, consumers of various types of media dislike excessive product placements (DeLorme and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reid, 1999)</ref> and express irritation in response.</p><p>Viewers who exhibit a high need to evaluate the positive and negative quali ties of an object are significantly more irritated by high-compared with lowcommercial density when watching a television program <ref type="bibr">(Fennis and Bakker, 2001)</ref>.

For example, both producing firms (studios) and place ment firms (advertisers) may have wanted to place more products if they thought the movie was of high quality.

Similarly, studios may have increased the number of screens for a high-quality movie, therefore the number of screens would have been correlated with the error term.</p><p>A first differencing operation could account for endogeneity by elim inat ing fixed effects (cm), but the model also included tim e-invariant independent variables, such as PLACE and PLAC-ESQ, that would have been eliminated by first differencing.</p><p>Instead, this study used a system "gen eralized method of moments" (GMM) esti mator <ref type="bibr">(Arellano and Bond, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Arellano and Bover, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Blundell and Bond, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and Rosen, 1998)</ref>. The system GMM estimator is appropriate for a small number of time periods and a large number of panels and when the independ ent variables are not strictly exogenous. The data consisted of 122 movies (panels), but some movies were shown as little as four weeks (time periods) in theaters. Sys tem GMM can estimate the coefficients of both time-varying (e.g., weekly screens and advertising) and time-invariant (e.g., MPAA rating, number of product place ments) variables while also accounting for fixed individual effects, heteroscedasticity, and autocorrelation within panels. Thus, the system GMM was advanta geous to the current researchers, in that it could control for unobserved heterogene ity without removing time-invariant inde pendent variables, by using equations in levels and in differences. That is, the sys tem GMM first estimated equations in levels and in differences. The estimator then was obtained by a weighted aver age of the coefficients from a structure of two equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">B = (X'Z (W)-1 Z'X)-1 (X'Z (W)-1 Z'Y) (2) X = V _XL , Y = 1 ----------1 i _____ l Zrf 0 ' Wd 0 Z,_ , W = 0</formula><p>where • B was the system GMM estimator matrix,</p><p>• X( was a matrix of transformed inde pendent variables (i.e., first differences), • X, was the matrix of original regressors (i.e., levels),</p><p>• Y( indicated the transformed dependent variable, • Y, was the original dependent variable, • Wrf offered a weighting matrix of the transformed equation, • W, was a weighting matrix of the orig inal equation, • Zd referred to the set of instruments in the transformed equation, and</p><p>• Z, was the set of instruments in the orig inal equation.</p><p>Econometrics literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Arellano and Bover, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Blundell and Bond, 1998</ref>) has demonstrated that system GMM estima tions could increase efficiency because they use not only levels but also differ ences of lagged variables as instruments.</p><p>Lagged variables in differences and in levels are orthogonal to error terms; there fore, both variables are relevant instru ments (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Arellano and Bover, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Blundell and Bond, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Roodman, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The assumption is that lagged explana tory variables do not correlate with cur rent error terms-that is, E(x , ■ e ,) = E(xm (_s ■ = 0 for s &gt; 2)-so the lagged independent variables are orthogonal to error terms in first differences (Equa tion 4).</p><p>Because the previous regressors and cur rent error terms were not correlated-that is, E(x . • e ,) = E(x , , • e ,) = 0 for s &gt; 2)-lagged regressors in differences and current errors in levels were orthogonal (Equation <ref type="formula">5</ref>). ■Ac ,) = 0 for s &gt; 2 mr (4)</p><p>• e ,) = 0 for s &gt; 2 where w was a time-invariant variable.</p><p>m</p><p>The system GMM estimation described above allowed the current researchers to</p><p>• obtain consistent and efficient estima tors of the effects of both the number of placements and its square to understand the relationship between product place ments and movie performance;</p><p>• control for endogeneity because of unob served heterogeneity from both studios and placing firms; and</p><p>• control for a variety of movie-specific factors and an overall time trend.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product P la c em e n ts and S atu ratio n</head><p>Pertinent to results from the system GMM estimation (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>) are the following:</p><p>• The coefficient of the number of product placements was positive and significant, so the number of placements had a posi tive relationship with revenues-what the authors believe to be a novel finding.</p><p>The empirical results affirmed that prod uct placement as advertising is positive for consumers.</p><p>• The coefficient of the square of the num ber of product placements was negative and significant, confirming the inverted U-shaped relationship between the number of placements and box office performance.</p><p>• Thus, when holding all other fac tors (star power, etc.) that could affect movie box office performance con stant, product placements showed a positive relationship with movie per formance, up to a certain point; how ever, excessive placements related negatively to performance after a sat uration point and became a negative for consumers.</p><p>• These effects were significant even after controlling for the total length of prod uct placements and the production budget of the movie.</p><p>After establishing a significant inverted U-shaped relationship with media per formance, the authors next turned to the saturation point for product placements. The estimated inflection point, using the coefficients of NPLACE and NPLACESQ, was approximately 44. That is, the initially positive relationship between product placements and revenues became negative after 44 placements (See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1</ref>).</p><p>Considering that the number of prod uct placements averaged about 16, studios generally appeared to keep the num ber of placements within a reasonable range. However, some movies featured a high numbers of placements, even exceeding 100 in some cases, such that the relationship between product place ments and revenue likely was negative in those cases.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outlier Analysis</head><p>To check the robustness of the current find ings, the researchers conducted an outlier analysis. The skewness (kurtosis) of the number of placements and total length of placements were 3.051 (12.038) and 3.133 (13.101), respectively; that is, the vari ables skewed to the right (See Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). To determine whether or not the results were affected by outliers, the researchers also ran the model after Winsorizing the num ber of placements or the total placement length. Winsorizing is a method to reduce the effect of potentially spurious outliers to ensure that extreme observations do not drive the results (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Rego, Morgan, and Fornell, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Tuli, Bharadwaj, and Kohli, 2010)</ref>. For the current research, the authors Winsorized at the 99th percentile, mean ing that any number of placements or total placement length above the 99th percentile were set to be equal to the 99th percentile.</p><p>As to the results from the system GMM estimation with these data; they remained similar and were robust to outliers (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does Low Budget or Low Quality</head><p>Drive the Results?</p><p>An alternative explanation for the inverted U-shaped relationship might be that mov ies with more product placements tend to be low budget or low quality, and studios actively seek financial resources from paid placements. Such low-budget, low-quality movies generally perform poorly at the box office-this study revealed a positive (though not significant) coefficient of pro duction budget and a positive, significant coefficient for WOM valence as proxy for quality (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>)-so these movies could be driving the negative quadratic coefficient (See Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>, p. 7). Empirical evidence, however, does not support the above explanation:</p><p>• In the correlation pattern among prod uct placements, production budget, and WOM valence as a proxy for quality (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref>), the correla tions between the number of placements and either production budget or WOM valence would be negative if low budget or low quality induced the inverted U-shaped relationship. Instead, these correlations were both positive (though not statisti cally significant), offering no evi dence that low-budget or low-quality movies included more product place m ents than their high-budget or high-quality counterparts.</p><p>• Production budget and WOM valence (i.e., quality) were included in the regression, so the significant inverted U-shaped relationship between product placements and performance persisted after controlling for these factors (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>).</p><p>• The instrumental variable approach (sys tem GMM estimator) accounted for unob served movie-specific heterogeneity, such as movie quality (See Equations 2 and 3, p. 9). The estimation results came after addressing the endogeneity of product placements because of potential correla tions among production budgets, movie quality, and other unobserved factors.</p><p>Together, the above three findings indi cate that low budgets or quality of The authors have argued that the signifi cant relationship between product place ments and programing performance likely reflected WOM, holding all other factors (star power, etc.) that could affect movieperformance constant. In other words, if product placements enhance realism and increase consumers' overall enjoyment of the film as the literature shows, then consumers should express more positive WOM. If this is true, then a significant relationship between the number of prod uct placements and WOM, as measured by online consumer ratings, should exist.</p><p>To verify this relationship, the authors ran the following regression model on the 122 movies used in the previous analysis:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">In WOM =P" + |31PLACE + P 2X 4,", + t1u,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>For each movie m:</p><p>• WOM was word of mouth valence as measured by the consumer rating (using its natural logarithm, because of its skewed distribution); and • PLACE was the number of placements.</p><p>Furthermore, X4 was a vector of moviespecific variables:</p><p>• the proportion of placements by major brands (MAJOR), as a proxy for brand familiarity; • the proportion of placements used by main characters (MAIN); • total screen time for all product place ments in a movie (LENGTH), as a control for product placement intensity; • total advertising spending (AD); • star power (STAR); • production budget (BUDGET);</p><p>• a dummy variable that indicates whether the movie is a sequel (SEQUEL); and • dummy variables for the MPAA ratings (MPAA), 17 genres (GENRE), and inde pendent films (INDIE).</p><p>All sources are the same as in previous analyses.</p><p>As with the previous analysis, given the host of factors (star power, etc.) that can affect WOM (and hence movie per formance), the X4 vector was included so the derived relationship between product placements and WOM held the aforemen tioned factors constant.</p><p>Again, the number of product placements may be endogenous because of unobserved movie-specific heterogeneity. Because the dependent variable was time-invariant, the current authors used an instrumental variable approach using studio dummies as instruments to deal with this potential endogeneity. Each studio's specific finan cial situation affects product-placement decisions. However, when deciding which movie to watch or when evaluating movies, consumers rarely consider studios <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Luan and Sudhir, 2010)</ref>. Therefore, studio dum mies would be uncorrelated with WOM but correlated with product placements, mak ing them relevant instrumental variables. The model was estimated by generalized method of moments (GMM) with robust standard errors (SEs).</p><p>The coefficient of product placements was positive and significant (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>). That is, product placements had a signifi cant positive relationship with WOM when holding the other factors constant. Among the control variables, MAJOR, MAIN, LENGTH, and STAR were not significant, nor was the INDIE dummy variable. AD and SEQUEL had positive, significant rela tionships, whereas BUDGET had a nega tive, significant relationship.</p><p>Together with the positive and signifi cant relationship found between WOM  media-performance outcome, up to a cer tain point. That is, when holding all other factors (star power, etc.) constant, prod uct placements increase consumer benefit (experience) when they are not excessive, resulting in a positive relationship with movie performance. This finding eluci dates the heretofore unknown relation ship between product placements and programing performance.</p><p>Additionally, the results revealed a posi tive relationship between the proportion of placements by major, familiar brands and movie performance, suggesting some important managerial implications:</p><p>• Firms that produce media programing and those that place advertising in such media can enjoy a win-win situation from product placements, especially if those placements involve major brands that are familiar to consumers.</p><p>• However, too much of this positive can become negative. As the num ber of placements passes a saturation point (44, as the current study demon strated), the relationship with movie performance turns negative. In particu lar, programing firms that give in to the temptation to allow too many place ments may suffer weaker programing performance when holding all other factors constant. The average number of placements in the current sample was 16, suggesting that movie studios might understand both the positive and the potential negative effects of product placements.</p><p>• Studios should continue to limit the number of product placements to a rea sonable boundary and avoid excessive placements (e.g., more than 50), which generally appear associated with poorer box office performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH</head><p>This investigation of the relationship between product placements and media programing used the number of place ments as a focal variable. A lack of data prevented the incorporation of the congru ence or fit of placed advertisements with the movie. In addition to the number or length of product placements, the seam lessness of the product placement with the flow of the movie may be an important fac tor. Secondary data about the fit between advertising and media programing are difficult to obtain, but assessments of fit would represent valuable additions to this research stream.</p><p>Moreover, the models in this study included advertising, but only that con ducted by the studio, because no data about cross-promotional advertising by the placed brands were available.
