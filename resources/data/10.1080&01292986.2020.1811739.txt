**Summary of Research Article**

- **Research Method:** The study employs a longitudinal and comparative research method, specifically utilizing quantitative content analysis and qualitative discourse analysis. The data collection involved examining the “People’s Daily,” the primary party newspaper, for articles that discuss citizenship rights. This was done using a full-text database covering the duration from January 1, 1978, to December 31, 2012, resulting in a collection of 6,224 news stories containing the keywords "citizen" and "rights." The data collection occurred through a specially designed constructed week sampling method that selected 70 weeks of articles, amounting to 234 stories analyzed, over a span of 35 years.

- **Time Relevant Details:** The data collection procedure spanned from 1978 to 2012 and was segmented into three key time intervals: 1978–1991, 1992–2001, and 2002–2012, corresponding to the three different administrations of Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao. Each year, a systematic random sampling strategy was used to collect articles from two constructed weeks to represent annual content.

- **Sampling Method and Entity Type:** The study utilized a constructed week sampling method to ensure balanced representation of articles across the years. The unit of analysis here is the media articles sourced from the “People’s Daily,” representing the entity type of media discourse related to citizenship rights, effectively analyzing the framing and construction of these rights over time.

- **Statistical Model:** The study’s analysis revolves around content categorization and the coded examination of numerous variables in the articles, such as types of content, topics, and rights categories, using established coding procedures to calculate reliability between coders, including Krippendorff’s alpha for intercoder reliability.

- **Unit of Analysis:** The unit of analysis in this research is the coded paragraphs from the collected articles that contained references to citizenship rights, with the coding focused on the presence of keywords and the thematic significance within the contexts discussed.

- **Number of Entities or Sample Size:** The analysis involved a total of 234 stories extracted from the 6,224 identified articles, resulting in 735 coded paragraphs being analyzed for various aspects of citizenship rights throughout the specified time intervals. This sample size provides a substantial overview of the media's portrayal of citizenship rights across three decades.

This study effectively delineates the evolution of media portrayals of citizenship rights in China, reflecting broader sociopolitical changes aligned with the changing leadership across specified timeframes.
