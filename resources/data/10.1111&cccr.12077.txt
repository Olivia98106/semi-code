The research article by Adina Schneeweis highlights the communication practices of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) advocating for Roma rights in Europe and critiques how these practices construct a discourse of victimization. Here is a summary focusing on the specified aspects:

- **Research Method**: The study employs a critical discourse analysis methodology to assess the communication materials produced by NGOs advocating for Roma rights. This analysis encompasses both longitudinal and historical perspectives, examining how the discourse around Roma victims has evolved from 1990 to 2006. 

- **Time Relevant Details**: Data collection was conducted through a systematic examination of 115 documents published by selected NGOs over the period from 1990 to 2006. This timeframe is crucial as it includes key developments in Roma advocacy following the end of Communism in Eastern Europe.

- **Sampling Method and Entity Type**: The sampling method included purposeful selection of five prominent NGOs based on criteria such as size, level of involvement, and legitimacy in the advocacy for Roma rights. The entities involved in the analysis include NGOs that engage with and communicate about the Roma community, thereby positioning them as the unit of analysis.

- **Statistical Model**: The article does not explicitly mention a traditional statistical model, as it focuses on qualitative discourse analysis rather than quantitative statistical methods. 

- **Unit of Analysis**: The unit of analysis utilized in the statistical model (or in this case, the qualitative discourse analysis) is the communication materials produced by the selected NGOs, particularly focusing on the discourse relating to Roma victims of discrimination.

- **Number of Entities or Sample Size**: The sample comprises 115 documents from five NGOs. Details about the contributions of individual NGOs, such as the number of documents analyzed from each organization (e.g., 44 from the ERRC and 36 from PER), provide clarity on the breakdown of materials considered in the analysis.

Overall, the article offers an in-depth critique of how the NGOs' narrative on Roma rights contributes to the ongoing construction of the Roma as victims, while also pointing out the implications of this representation on both advocacy efforts and public perceptions.
