### Summary of Research Article: Observatory's Linguistic Landscape

#### Research Method
The study employed a longitudinal ethnographic approach, focusing on the linguistic landscape (LL) of Observatory's business corridor, particularly along Lower Main Road. Data collection involved detailed observations and photographic documentation of the LL over a span of four years, with specific timings noted from the end of 2008 to 2011. Regular intervals of data collection were utilized to capture dynamic changes, specifically in signage reflecting the community's evolving socio-cultural context.

#### Time Relevant Details
Data collection occurred continuously across the four-year duration, allowing the researchers to track changes in signage and community presence over time. This involved examining the LL at distinct intervals to analyze how community identities and appropriations of space transformed throughout the study period.

#### Sampling Method and Entity Type
A purposive sampling method was employed to focus on specific enterprises and locations within Observatory that exemplified linguistic and semiotic changes. The entities involved included a variety of businesses, such as restaurants and supermarkets, owned by individuals of diverse ethnic backgrounds, showcasing the multicultural fabric of the community. The unit of analysis in the study comprised individual businesses and their respective signage.

#### Statistical Model
The analysis used a qualitative approach, employing a multimodal analytical framework to understand how signs and symbols interacted within the LL, rather than relying on traditional statistical models. This involved examining patterns in semiotic appropriation and the transformation of space over time.

#### Unit of Analysis
The unit of analysis was the individual business and its signage within the neighborhood, emphasizing the interplay between language, culture, and spatial appropriation.

#### Number of Entities or Sample Size
The studyâ€™s results indicated an analysis of at least 20 distinct businesses along Lower Main Road, as evidenced in various figures throughout the article, such as signage changes from the Ezithebeni Braai Lounge and other local establishments, illustrating the diverse influences on and identity of the neighborhood's LL across the study span.
