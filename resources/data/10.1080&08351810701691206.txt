**Research Method:**  
The study, employing a longitudinal single-case approach, investigates the emergence of self-repair practices in a child aged between 1 and 3 years and 6 months. Data collection involved detailed video recordings of interactions between the child and her father, capturing various conversational contexts. The data collection spanned a significant duration, with intervals of observation set to track developmental milestones and repair practices.

**Time Relevant Details:**  
The data collection occurred over an extended period, with sessions recorded at different time intervals corresponding to the child's development (e.g., 1;8, 2;1, 2;5, 2;9, and up to 3;5 years). Each dataset captured instances of conversation and interaction, which helped in documenting the frequency and nature of self-repair events as the child matured.

**Sampling Method and Entity Type:**  
A purposive sampling method was implemented, focusing on a single child as the main entity. The entity type involved individuals, specifically a preschool child and her father, serving as key participants in the conversational interactions being analyzed.

**Statistical Model:**  
The analysis utilized a mixed methods approach, blending qualitative observational analysis with a quantitative assessment of repair frequency and types. The analysis largely relied on conversation analysis frameworks to interpret data.

**Unit of Analysis:**  
The unit of analysis in the study is centered on conversational exchanges or speech events within the dual interactions between the child and her father. This includes instances of self-repair, other-initiated repair, and the contextual dynamics influencing these reparative actions.

**Number of Entities or Sample Size:**  
The analysis focused on a single child, thus the sample size comprises one preschool-aged child over the duration of the study, with several conversational interactions documented in the recorded settings. The detailed examination of these exchanges provided rich insights into the childâ€™s developmental progress in communicative competence.
