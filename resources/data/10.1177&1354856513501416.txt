Here's a summary of the research article with focus on the specified aspects:

- **Research Method**: The study employs a longitudinal research method utilizing national media and opinion surveys conducted by Swedenâ€™s SOM Institute. Through rhetorical analysis, the authors investigate the evolution and implications of the survey questions over time, specifically from 1995 to 2012. The data collection involved surveys focusing on media usage and public opinion, with evolving question formats reflecting changes in media convergence.

- **Time Relevant Details**: Data collection occurred continuously throughout the period of analysis (1995-2012) with surveys administered annually. Specific questions about media usage and access were modified over the years to adapt to technological developments, such as the shift to digital media platforms. There were time intervals wherein questions regarding the frequency of Internet use evolved from basic binary responses (i.e., access or no access) to scaled responses measuring duration and purpose of usage.

- **Sampling Method and Entity Type**: The sampling method used by SOM involves representative population surveys, focusing on individuals within the Swedish populace, making the entities analyzed individual respondents reflecting media consumption and engagement behaviors.

- **Statistical Model**: The article employs a triangular vector composition model for its analysis, which integrates the conceptual components of platform, content, and user protocol within the context of media convergence.

- **Unit of Analysis**: The unit of analysis in the statistical model is the individual respondent's media consumption behavior as captured through the SOM survey questions.

- **Number of Entities or Sample Size**: Although specific details about sample size are not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, it is indicated that SOM has conducted these surveys for nearly 30 years, likely involving sizable representative samples typical of national surveys, suggesting multiple thousands of individual responses over time.

This summary provides an overarching view of the article's approach, methods, and findings concerning the evolution of media convergence and its implications as reflected in longitudinal survey data.
