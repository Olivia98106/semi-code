**Research Method:**
The study utilized a longitudinal research method focusing on massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) players. Data was collected using open-ended survey questions designed to provoke reflections on participant experiences and feelings towards the stereotypes associated with gaming. The data collection spanned from 2009 to 2012, allowing for insights over several time points rather than a singular moment.

**Time Relevant Details:**
Within the longitudinal study, data collection involved multiple intervals to gauge changes in participantsâ€™ perceptions and identity management strategies over time. Survey questions prompted participants to reflect on who they played with, activities they engaged in while gaming, and their reactions to prevalent stereotypes. The encouragement to provide contextual information indicated an iterative process where responses were analyzed as they were collected at various stages of the research.

**Sampling Method and Entity Type:**
The sampling method employed was purposive sampling, targeting self-identified MMOG players, with participants recruited from university campuses and gaming events. The entities involved were individuals, specifically adult gamers who engage with MMOGs, thereby serving as the focal unit of analysis.

**Statistical Model:**
The analysis relied on descriptive statistical methods to interpret the qualitative data gathered from survey responses. These methods helped in identifying themes and patterns regarding the self-perception and social stigma associated with MMOG gaming.

**Unit of Analysis:**
The unit of analysis in this study was individual respondents, specifically focusing on their personal experiences, identities, and reflections regarding MMOG play and societal stereotypes.

**Number of Entities or Sample Size:**
The study comprised a sample size of 215 participants, as indicated within the results section and data tables. The substantial number of responses provided a rich dataset for analyzing identity construction and responses to stereotypes among MMOG players.
