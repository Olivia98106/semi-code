**Summary of the Research Article: "Nextness and story organization: ‘my day’ sequences in parent-child interaction"**

- **Research Method**: The study employs a longitudinal conversation analysis (CA) method, focusing on audio recordings of parent-child interactions. Data collection occurred every two weeks over a period of eighteen months, allowing researchers to track changes in interactional practices and story structures over time.

- **Time Relevant Details**: Audio-recordings were captured at regular intervals, specifically every two weeks, which enabled the researchers to observe the evolution of storytelling among participants. The longitudinal aspect of the data set offers a chronological tracking of the child’s narrative abilities.

- **Sampling Method and Entity Type**: The sampling method involved convenience sampling of a father-child pair. The entities involved are individual participants; the unit of analysis here is the conversational interaction between the parent and the child.

- **Statistical Model**: The analysis employed a qualitative approach rather than a traditional statistical model. The researchers examined sequential organization and storytelling structure within the recorded conversational data, highlighting changes in children's narrative skills and parental scaffolding over time.

- **Unit of Analysis**: The unit of analysis used in the study is the conversational exchange between parent and child, specifically focusing on the storytelling sequences prompted by parental questions.

- **Number of Entities or Sample Size**: The analysis is based on recordings from one father-child pair over the specified eighteen-month duration. The specific number of recorded interactions is not detailed in the summary but is implied to be extensive given the bi-weekly data collection protocol.

This article provides significant insights into the dynamics of parent-child storytelling, illustrating how narrative skills develop contextually and sequentially through interactional practices.
